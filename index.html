<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>What is this?</em>
</h3>

<p>We know that Tinychat bots have existed for a long time. Initially started by smaller individuals, the likes of MegaLoler and re-constructed for Python by Nola (GitHub below). This is a redefined version for people who intend to use bots in rooms, however we have not tried to be too specific with the style of coding and the commands, as we would like <em>YOU</em> to improve it further!</p>

<p>The bot will be updated by all of us as time progresses and whatever new changes Tinychat makes, we will match side-by-side to provide the most functional and easy to use bot. Just briefly we would like to mention <a href="https://github.com/nortxort/pinylib">pinylib</a> author <strong>nortxort</strong> for the base of this bot and for his major contributions with creating it.</p>

<p>As well as that a special mention to Nola who made the pinychat library, which was the clearest python library implementation of Tinychat (redefined from MegaLoler's work). Without that we could have never made any of this.</p>

<a id="the-repository" class="anchor" href="#the-repository" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The repository</h3>

<p>Our repository is located at <a href="https://github.com/oddballz/pinybot">oddballz/pinybot</a> (a simple group of members who all share the same interest). Feel free to browse the <em>pinybot</em> repository and view the README before you install any dependencies you may or may not require. 

<p>Additionally we also have a <a href="https://github.com/oddballz/pinybot-OpenShift">pinybot-OpenShift</a> repository within the organisation/group page which contains sample server files for <a href="https://www.openshift.com/">OpenShiftÂ®</a> setup and a nearly "click to install and use" configuration.</p>

<p>If you already have an OpenShift account setup, be sure to click on the logo below to install straight to OpenShift and deploy the bot!</p>
