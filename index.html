<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><em>What is this?</em>
</h3>

<p>We know that Tinychat bots have existed for a long time. Started mainly with smaller individuals, namely MegaLoler and re-constructed by Nola (GitHub at the bottom). This is a redefined version for people who intend to use bots on the rooms, however we have not tried to be too specific with the style of coding and the commands as we would like <em>YOU</em> to improve it!</p>

<p>The bot will be updated by all of us as time progresses and whatever new Tinychat changes are made, we will have to adhere to them, to keep this bot functional. Just briefly we would like to mention <a href="https://github.com/nortxort/pinylib">pinylib</a> author <strong>nortxort</strong> for the base of this bot and for his major contributions with creating it. As well as that a special mention to Nola who made the pinychat library which was the clearest python library implementation of Tinychat (redefined from MegaLoler's work). Without that we could have never made any of this.</p>
