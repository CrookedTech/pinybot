                <li>New toggle for auto_url mode, links made to privacy_settings.py (Line 217), splitting lines character for auto_pm replaced from "Â¬" to "|" for easier use (L275). </li>
                <li>New tidy_exit function when receiving "on_quit" from a clients exit to handle sorting related lists (L368), fixed double on_quit error with tidy_exit - double run
                    of the function which resulted in the user being non-existent in the room_users dictionary (L362/363).
                </li>
                <li>Bot listening has been improved - still needs to be checked (L573).</li>
                <li>Fixed old mobile parsing issues, in correspondence with pinylib, new parsing method (L230).</li>

                    Rather than checking for if the playlist was greater than zero, we check for an active timer thread instead (L1946).

                <li>Mutability error in _send_command method with passing params list has been resolved, with the construction of the parameters
                    as a list within the function (L1196).
                </li>
                <li>encode_msg/decode_msg methods are static now (L1455/1464).</li>
