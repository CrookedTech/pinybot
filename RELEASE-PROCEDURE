# Release procedure

This is just a brief outline as to how releases and project updates will work.

In terms of releases alone, pinybot's releases will be based on its MAJOR versions revisions i.e.
when it hits version 2, 3 etc. In all these releases there will an executable released alongside it
as it is an official release and can be used without fear of particular bugs/issues.

The MINOR revisions will still be comitted to the project and this will feature new modules/addons
and essential fixes to larger bugs which cannot simply be fixed via a PATCH.

The PATCHES themselves will be released on a maintenance basis, whenever there are protocol changes or 
if there are smaller code revisions or simple fixes we have to change a patch will be pushed to the
repository appropriately.
