{"name":"pinybot","tagline":"The true base for your Tinychat bot needs.","body":"## Welcome to the **pinybot** repository homepage\r\n\r\n### *What is this?*\r\n\r\nWe know that Tinychat bots have existed for a long time. Started mainly with smaller individuals, namely MegaLoler and re-constructed by Nola (GitHub at the bottom). This is a redefined version for people who intend to use bots on the rooms, however we have not tried to be too specific with the style of coding and the commands as we would like *YOU* to improve it!\r\n\r\nThe bot will be updated by all of us as time progresses and whatever new Tinychat changes are made, we will have to adhere to them, to keep this bot functional. Just briefly we would like to mention [pinylib](https://github.com/nortxort/pinylib) author **nortxort** for the base of this bot and for his major contributions with creating it. As well as that a special mention to Nola who made the pinychat library which was the clearest python library implementation of Tinychat (redefined from MegaLoler's work). Without that we could have never made any of this.\r\n\r\n### The repository\r\n\r\nOur repository is located at [oddballz/pinybot](https://github.com/oddballz/pinybot) (a simple group of members who all share the same interest). Feel free to browse the **pinybot** repository and view the README before you install any dependencies you may or may not require. The **pinybot-OpenShift** branch of the repository contains our sample server files for [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) setup and a nearly \"click to install and use\" configruation.\r\n\r\nIf you already have an OpenShift account setup, be sure to just click on the logo below to install straight to OpenShift and deploy!\r\n\r\n![https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/custom?cartridges%5B%5D=python-2.7&initial_git_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Foddballz%2Fpinybot.git&name=pinybot](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3667e9e3846dff6e119eb179d3a12328a441a722/687474703a2f2f6c61756e63682d736869667465722e7268636c6f75642e636f6d2f627574746f6e2e737667)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThere are several people who authored/contributed to this repository in whatever shape or form.
